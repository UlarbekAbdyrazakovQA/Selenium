 Locators

 Cashwise login functionality

 Scenarious of testing functionality

 1.Happy path-> positive scenario типа баржокту туура жазып кирип коргон учур
 2.Try to login with wrong credentials
 3.Pass username and leave password empty and try to login and vice versa
 4.Don't pass anything and try to login

 Normally we find bug while we checking manually

 These scenarious MUST be automated so that in the future code changes, it will be easy to check if new changes wouldn't
 break the existing functionalities.

 There are 8 ways to find a web element using selenium


 Expected result  =  Actual result (тестингде ушул экоо бирдей болуш керек)

 Synchronization in Selenium

 *Code in IntelliJ and Browser must be synchronized. Otherwise it throws Exception.

 1. How to pause the code execution?
 -Thread.sleep(milli seconds)

DATE: 9 May -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talking is important in interview

Steps of testing anything:

1. Firstly I Get the requirement

Synchronization issue - это когда код работает быстрее вебсайта и код не замечает вебэлементы

*Once we find that Web element ,what we do?
-To perform the operation to that web element

*What is WebElement in selenium?
- It is a data type that can store located web element

*What happens when seleniium doesn't find an element?
-it throws NoSuchElementException


Dynamic locators лучше не выбирать потому что они могут меняться

//div[4] 4чу див берет только если алар бир лэвэлде болсо типа sibling болот
 если ичинде толтура div ар кандай левелде болсо аларды группа кылып алсак болот

 (//div)[4] скобка менен баарын бир левел кылып алдык анан тортунчусун таптык

//div[@class='jumbotron']  or //*[@class='jumbotron']  -> найди все div(если там * то это значит все тэги) у
которых есть class по имени "jumbotron"



//*[.="your text"] - найди мне все тэги с таким текстом деген(to locate element with outer text


/html/body/div[2]/text()


//*[@id="user-name"]

*Dropdown
How to test dropdowns:
-1.Default selected option
-2.Check list of options
-3.Select different option and check if it is selected
-4.Test th functionality. When you select some option

*How to get current selected option?
- method called getFirstSelectedOption

SOFT SKILLS


- Product Backlog -> list of all desired requirements. So many features, functionalities, changes,tasks are
going to be here (продуктка кошкусу келген функциялардын списогу ,толтура болушу мумкун ал списокто).
-In a team 8 people :
                    3 backend
                    1 front end
                    2 QA
                    1 manual
                    1 Business analyst


- Tell me about your team:  I am in a scrum team , in agile environment , we usually have in our team 3 or 4 backend
developers because sometimes one of our backend developers could switch to the other team if there was need for backend
and also we were working in crossplatform . And we had 1 manual and 2 QA engineers for automation, 1 frontend and
1 ux/ui designer.




------------   BUG   ------------------

        Bug life cycle
1)Summary - short summary about bug ticket (ex: result for flight search is coming same for all parameters)
2)Description - more detailed information about bug(ex: when you choose any city for departure or destination and
search flight, the search result is giving the same data)

Steps to reproduce:
-1.go to app blazedemo
-2. select any city for departure and destination
-3. click search flight button

Expected result:
 The flights that belong to the selected cities should come
Actual result:
 Showing the same flight table for any city i choose

Attachment. Screenshot.

3)Severity: How critical is this BUG? ex: critical, major, minor, low

4)Priority: When it needs to be fixed? High, medium, low

--------
Where do you create bug?
-Software Development Management System/Tool/Platform
a.JIRA
b.Trello
c.CRM platforms
d.On click



Troubleshooting - is analyzing to find the root of issue

Build <-> Deployment (they are same)



Share conflict disagreement? (interview question)

- Just recently i got a disagreement with dev team because the bug which i found wasn't fixed but in Jira they mentioned
that it was fixed , then i just assigned back that  bug to dev team and they were crazy about it , then we just communicate
me , BA and dev team and we realised that we were both right and the issue was in server side , i mean devops side which
i don't understand , then they just fixed and they deployed new code base and everything was good.

***************    Utilities    *************

1) We create a package called utils or utilities
2)Here we will be creating many utility classes that are going to be useful and reusable
3)Utilities can be for anything. As long as they are useful when we do automation testing, and also they should be
 universal so that i can use many times.

4)Utilities should be easy to use. No complication. No extra lines of code.
5)Libraries normally already have some utilities. Even Java have utilities.
6)The purpose of the Utility should be easy to use without looking into the backend. If something is always used and
long lines of code, this can be utility so that we avoid writing the same long code again and again.


implicitwait?

ans: it is a setting that gives a chance to webelement to be located in that duration of time.

                        How many environments we are testing? -QA-> Staging(проверяем с реальными )-> Production
                                                                            (данными от продакшна  )
Types of Testing:
-Regression testing - to make sure new functionality did not break old functionalities. We do automating regression test.
We do get report about regression testing.(Or regression is also when we are running all tests)

- Smoke Testing -> only the main functionalities of the application.(it can be automated)

- Ad hod testing ->

- Backend testing -> testing the database, to make sure data in UI is accurate and matches the data in the backend

- UAT - user acceptance testing , ususally done by PO,BA,or actual users, to make sure software was built the way they
wanted.

- Performance testing how the system is handling several users using the application at the same time, what is the
responses time of certain button or functionality.

-Integration testing =>making sure different units,components, modules of the application are working together as one.

-Functional testing -> all the functions of the applications are working per requirements.

-Unit testing -> testing your own code, usually done by the developers.

-Sanity testing -> almost the same as smoke testing, quick and basic test of important functionalities. Making sure
nothing broke after the code change.

QA environment?

- It is separate server where developers/devops are deploying the production type like application with ONE purpose.
For TESTING ONLY.
- Simply this is NOT going to look like a real and main URL for the application.

Ex: www.qa.chase.com(for testing)
    www.chase.com(the real one)

* There can be many environments for QA such as

www.qa1.chase.com
www.qa2.chase.com
www.qa3.chase.com
www.qa4.chase.com


* Companies try to put bigger servers for the QA environments. Because it should simulate the real production
environment.

Test Data
-this a data which we will need to test something

Where do we get the test data?
- It is not from the requirement.
- Pre requirements: the information that we need before we test.

-With help of MAVEN it is automating the management of  dependencies and building the project.

         Data Driven Development Approach(PROPERTIES)

- We don't write the data inside our codes.
- We import it from outside centralized place.

When we write data inside our code, it is called HARD CODED.

                JUNIT(it is a Tool, framework)


-Junit primarily used for unit testing

* What is Unit Testing?
- Testing the source code. Testing your own code

*Which test method is going to run first?
-JUnit doesn't guarantee to run any if the tests in order.
-JUnit

-Assertion help us to chech expected result and actual result.

Build: building a java project
1.writing the code
2.compile the code
3.testing the code
4.managing the dependencies
5.Extracting the code for development as library/jar file
and in order to automate this things MAVEN is helpful.

-We are testing something according to expected behaviour of it.(ex: если log out кылып атсан можешь url чекнуть или
например you r logged out деп чыгатурган popup бар болсо ошонун текстин эле алып текшерип корсок болот)

-There maybe many check points(assertions).
-Whenever assertion fails it will stop there.


                PAGE OBJECT MODEL

-A design pattern used in selenium for creating an object repository for web pages. The main idea behind this pattern
is to create a class for each web page or section of a web page that contains
